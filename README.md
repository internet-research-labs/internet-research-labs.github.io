## About

Internet Research Labs is a discussion about art in the digital era.

## Manifesto

We can trace a line from cave paintings to the old masters. However, the modern
art fails to achieve this connection. Rather, in a sense, the digital realm is
the new cave painting, and things referenced about it now will be seen as such.

However, the litany of philosophical ideas is now a basis for what we're doing
with the cave walls. So, we're drawing on Plato's Cave's Wall.

Philosophy is more an inspiration for the modern art, than the art of the
previous century.

`Original idea of repreentation -> Cave Drawings -> Illustration -> Painting and Printing Making -> End`
`Meta ideas of representation -> Digital Art`

However, I would like to give a shout-out to the old masters and
**Ibn al-Haytham** for developing the framework of perspective for modern
computer graphics.
